      <h2>Sasha</h2>
      <p>This is my cat Sasha that I acquired when an old couple couldn't keep their cat as they were moving to an area that didn't allow animals.
      <p>She is probably one of the greatest cats in existence as she doesn't chew cords or scratch people.</p>

      <h2>Mickey</h2>
      <p>This is my dog mickey who my parents got in the hopes that he would be a good breeder dog.
      <p>To seperate him from the other male dog we had to house him in another area, and he slowly became my dog.</p>
